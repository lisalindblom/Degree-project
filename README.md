# A Mending Hand

This is my degreeproject as a frontend developer studying at Medieinstitutet.

In this project I have created a platform where you can learn about how to give their clothing a longer life.

The user can follow guides on how to mend, remake or reuse clothing. It also contains information about fabrics, sewing and the environmental impact of our current consumption of clothing.

To see it live, visit: [A Mending Hand](https://a-mending-hand.netlify.app/)
